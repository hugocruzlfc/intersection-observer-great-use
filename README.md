## Use Case 1: Lazy Loading for Improved Performance

### Benefits of lazy loading with React Intersection Observer

#### Faster page load: By deferring image loading, initial page load times improve, leading to better user engagement and reducing initial page load time.

#### Improved core web vitals: Metrics like largest contentful paint (LCP) benefit from lazy loading, boosting your app’s SEO and Google Lighthouse scores.

#### Reduced data usage: Users on slower connections or limited data plans benefit from reduced data usage as images load on demand.

#### Smoother scrolling: Scrolling feels more responsive, as heavy images don’t download upfront, preventing janky page jumps.

#### Improved user experience: Users see the content they are interested in faster, leading to a better overall experience
