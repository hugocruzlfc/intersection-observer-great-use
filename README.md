## Use Case 1: Lazy Loading for Improved Performance

### Benefits of lazy loading with React Intersection Observer

#### Faster page load: By deferring image loading, initial page load times improve, leading to better user engagement and reducing initial page load time.

#### Improved core web vitals: Metrics like largest contentful paint (LCP) benefit from lazy loading, boosting your app’s SEO and Google Lighthouse scores.

#### Reduced data usage: Users on slower connections or limited data plans benefit from reduced data usage as images load on demand.

#### Smoother scrolling: Scrolling feels more responsive, as heavy images don’t download upfront, preventing janky page jumps.

#### Improved user experience: Users see the content they are interested in faster, leading to a better overall experience

## Use Case 2: Infinite Scrolling with the Intersection Observer

### Benefits of infinite scrolling with React Intersection Observer

#### Improved user experience: Users can seamlessly scroll through content without interruptions, providing a more engaging experience.

#### Efficient resource usage: Resources are only loaded when needed, reducing unnecessary data fetching and rendering.

#### Simplified navigation: Removes the need for traditional pagination links, simplifying the navigation experience for users.

#### Improved performance: Fine-grained observation avoids unnecessary calculations and content loading.

#### Increased visibility: Metrics like Time to Interactive benefit, boosting SEO and Google Lighthouse scores.
